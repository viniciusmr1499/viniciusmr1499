## Hi there üëã  
###  Welcome to my profile :octocat:

My name is Marcos Vin√≠cius and I am a systems developer with over 4 years of experience in the market. I hold a degree in Analysis and Systems Development and am currently pursuing post-graduation studies in Software Engineering, DevOps, and Cloud Computing.

With a wide range of technical skills, I work with various languages and tools, including JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Python, MongoDB, DynamoDB, Kafka, Docker, Redis, NestJS, Next JS, ReactJS, GraphQL, Fastify, Cache, AWS Lambda, SQS, SNS, S3, Stack ELK, MySQL, Postgres, and MariaDB. As a micro frontend architecture enthusiast, I use Webpack with module federation to deliver scalable and innovative solutions.

My commitment to quality is evident in my code, as I follow the best practices and concepts of SOLID and Clean Code. In the backend, I work with microservices and implement code that respects well-known design patterns, such as ports and adapters, factory, and decorators. I use good security practices, such as authentication and authorization with Keycloak, ensuring that my solutions are always secure and reliable.

I have experience in agile methodologies, including Kanban and Planning Poker. My qualifications in Software Engineering, DevOps, and Cloud Computing allow me to have a complete understanding of the software lifecycle, from conception to deployment and maintenance.

My goal is always to deliver cutting-edge technological solutions that exceed my clients' and users' expectations. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow and develop my skills.
